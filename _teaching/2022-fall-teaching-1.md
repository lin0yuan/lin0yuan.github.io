I served as one of the six undergraduate teaching assistants for more than 270 sophomores taking BCHE2030 (Fundamentals of Biochemistry), a SLS core course. I held bi-weekly tutorials and Q&A sessions to enhance students' understanding of concepts taught in lectures and offer them chances to practice and apply what they learnt. Here are the slides we prepared for tutorials:
