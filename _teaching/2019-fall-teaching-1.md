As a member of Fujia Shenzhen Lychee Program, one of the recognized CUHK I·CARE Social Service Projects, I organized weekly voluntary teaching sessions for about 40 children at the Children Services Center in Yuanfen, a migrant-worker community in Shenzhen. Here is a [photo](https://lin0yuan.github.io/images/teaching_2019fall.jpg) of us taken at the end of our last teaching.
