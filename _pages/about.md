Hi there~ I am Lin, a PhD student working on evolutionary and population genomics at [**Cornell University**](https://www.cornell.edu/). I am currently on my First-Year Rotations of [**Genetics, Genomics, and Development (GGD) Program**](https://gendev.cornell.edu/).

Before that, I graduated with a B.Sc. in Cell and Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science from [**the Chinese University of Hong Kong**](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I also had lovely time at [Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School](https://www.pkusz.edu.cn/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and [Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en) for term-time exchanges and summer research.

[**Here is my CV (Last update: August 2024)**](https://lin0yuan.github.io/files/CV_202408.pdf)

I have eternal curiosity and passion about science and research, and am more than willing to talk with people on new ideas! I am also excited about science promotion and enjoy engaging with young students and the community. 

## Research Interests
I am pretty much interested in working on genomics, using computational methods to make the sequence speaks. So far I have been working on:
    1. Evaluating the effect of genetic rescue in Florida Panthers (*Puma concolor*) 
    2. Investigating the evolution and genetic basis of coloration in strawberry poison frogs (*Oophaga pumilio*) 
    3. Revealing the herbivory evolution of mangrove crabs (*Episesarma versicolor*, *Parasesarma bidens*, and *Metopograpsus frontalis*)
**Feel free to contact me if you have anything to discuss!** 


## Hobbies
In my spare time, I love cooking & baking, visiting museums, listening to classical music, and practicing Zheng (Chinese plucked zither). I love traveling to different places, feeling their cultures, tasting their foods and recreating them in my own kitchen. I enjoy playing board games with families and friends, and recently I am keen on playing [Hanabi](https://hanabi.github.io/), a cooperative card game. I am currently on Lv.9. Please contact me if you wanna practice with me~

I will have a page here sooner or later to document my cookings and favorite recipes :D
