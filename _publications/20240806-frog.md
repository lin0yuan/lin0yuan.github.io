We studied the evolutionary and genetic causes of color and pattern polymorphism in aposematic strawberry poison frogs in Bocas del Toro Archipelago. Exomes were sequenced from 347 individuals from ten populations and a number of genetic factors were mapped responsible for the color and pattern variation. The causal genetic regions showed evidence of selective sweeps acting locally to spread the rare phenotype.
